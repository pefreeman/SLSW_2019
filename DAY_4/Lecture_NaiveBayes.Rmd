The Model
===

The Naive Bayes classifier is a simple probabilistic classifier that has been around for 50+ years and is a popular baseline model for text classification, particularly spam detection. Why it is called "naive" and "Bayes" will become more clear below.

Naive Bayes is a *conditional probability model*: given a vector of predictor variable values $\mathbf{x}$, the algorithm assigns conditional probabilities for each of the response variable's $K$ classes:
$$
p(C_k \vert \mathbf{x}) \,.
$$
The conventional decision rule is the so-called *MAP*, or *maximum a posteriori* rule: pick the class that is most probable.

But: how does one estimate $p(C_k \vert \mathbf{x})$?

The Derivation
===

The first step is to apply Bayes' rule from probability theory (hence, the "Bayes"):
$$
p(C_k \vert \mathbf{x}) = \frac{p(C_k)p(\mathbf{x} \vert C_k)}{p(\mathbf{x})} \propto p(C_k)p(\mathbf{x} \vert C_k)
$$
We do not care about the value of the denominator, which is a constant in any given analysis.

The next step is to expand $p(\mathbf{x} \vert C_k)$:
\begin{eqnarray*}
p(\mathbf{x} \vert C_k) &=& p(x_1,\ldots,x_p \vert C_k) \\
&=& p(x_1 \vert x_2,\ldots,x_p,C_k) p(x_2 \vert x_3,\ldots,x_p,C_k) \cdots p(x_p \vert C_k)
\end{eqnarray*}

The third step is where the "naive" aspect of the classifier comes into play. We assume (perhaps correctly, but probably incorrectly) that the predictor variables are all mutually independent, i.e., that
\begin{eqnarray*}
p(x_1 \vert x_2,\ldots,x_p,C_k) p(x_2 \vert x_3,\ldots,x_p,C_k) \cdots p(x_p \vert C_k) \rightarrow p(x_1 \vert C_k) \cdots p(x_p \vert C_k)
\end{eqnarray*}

So in the end:
$$
p(C_k \vert \mathbf{x}) \propto p(C_k) \prod_{i=1}^n p(x_i \vert C_k)
$$

Further Assumptions
===

To utilize Naive Bayes, one needs to assign "prior probabilities" $p(C_k)$ and needs to assume conditional distributions for each class:

* Common choices for $p(C_k)$ are $1/K$ (equal probabilities for each class) and $n_k/N$ (the number of training data in class $k$ divided by the training set sample size).
* As for $p(x_i \vert C_k)$:
   + if $x_i$ is a quantitative variable, one often assumes that $p(x_i \vert C_k)$ is a normal distribution, with mean  and variance given by the sample mean and sample variance of the training data in class $k$; or
   + if $x_i$ is a categorial variable, one often assumes that $p(x_i \vert C_k)$ is a binomial distribution (if there are two categories) or a multinomial distribution (if there are more than two categories), with the relative proportions of each category informing the category probability estimate.

Bottom Line
===

Why use Naive Bayes?

- Because of the assumption of mutual independence, the mathematics is considerably simplified and the algorithm is thus *fast*. This is especially helpful for large datasets.

Why not use Naive Bayes?

- The assumption of mutual independence would rarely hold in practice. Thus one sacrifices information about the joint distribution of predictor variables for computational speed.

$\Rightarrow$ Given its speed and ease of implementation, it never hurts to try Naive Bayes out. Do not expect it to win the misclassification error battle...but be happy if it does!

Naive Bayes: Example
===

Let's see how the Naive Bayes classifier works with our star-QSO dataset.
```{r echo=FALSE}
df = read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pefreeman/PSU_2019/master/StarQuasar.csv")
set.seed(202)
s = sample(nrow(df),0.7*nrow(df))
pred.train = df[s,1:5]                                  # don't include redshift or redshift error!
pred.test  = df[-s,1:5]
resp.train = df[s,8]
resp.test  = df[-s,8]
```
```{r}
if ( require(naivebayes) == FALSE ) {
  install.packages("naivebayes",repos="https://cloud.r-project.org")
  library(naivebayes)
}
out.nb = naive_bayes(resp.train~.,data=pred.train)
resp.pred = predict(out.nb,newdata=pred.test,type="class")
mean(resp.pred!=resp.test)
table(resp.pred,resp.test)
```
